# Abstract

# Introduction

Datasets representing route networks are a key output of transport models.
Much research has focussed on their generation \[...\] and visualisation.

[@morgan2020] presented methods for combining multiple overlapping routes into a single route network with non-overlapping linestrings for visualisation.

$$
\sigma = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}
$$
