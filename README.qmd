# networkmerge

A minimal example dataset was created with the ATIP tool.
The example dataset can be found in the `data` folder.

To read-in the data into Python we used the following:

```{python}
import geopandas as gpd
network = gpd.read_file("data/minimal-input.geojson")
# Column names:
network.columns

# colour is based on 'description' column
network.plot(column='value')
```


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: false
# Create input dataset:
network = sf::read_sf("data/minimal-example-2-scotthall-road.geojson")
network$description = as.numeric(network$description)
network = network["description"]
network$value = c(1, 2)
network = stplanr::overline(network, attrib = "value")
network
sf::write_sf(network, "data/minimal-input.geojson")
plot(network[1, "value"])
plot(network[2, "value"])
network_merged = network
network_merged$value[2] = network_merged$value[1] + network_merged$value[2]
network_merged = network_merged[-1, ]
plot(network_merged)
sf::write_sf(network_merged, "data/minimal-output.geojson")
```
